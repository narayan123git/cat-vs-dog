# Cat vs Dog Classification 🐱🐶

This project classifies images of cats and dogs using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** on **Google Colab**.

## 📌 Features
- Uses **CNN** for image classification
- Built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Trained on labeled cat and dog images
- Evaluates model performance and predicts new images

## 📂 Dataset
- Uses **Kaggle's Cat vs Dog dataset**
- Images are preprocessed and augmented for better accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Google Colab**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV**

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/narayan123git/cat-vs-dog-classification.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## 📊 Results
- Achieves high accuracy on cat vs dog classification
- Can be further improved with fine-tuning
